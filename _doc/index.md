Redstone.dart is a server-side, metadata driven microframework for [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/). 

#### How does it work?
Redstone.dart allows you to easily publish your functions and classes through a web interface, by just adding some annotations to them. 

{% include code.func code="hello_world.dart" %}

Does this example look familiar? Redstone.dart took a lot of ideas and concepts from the Python's [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) microframework.
