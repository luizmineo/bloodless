Redstone is an annotation driven web server micro-framework for [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) and influenced by [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). It is based on [shelf](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/shelf) so you may also use any shelf middleware you like with Redstone.

#### Example
Redstone allows you to easily publish functions through a web interface, by just adding some annotations to them.

```dart
import 'package:redstone/redstone.dart' as web;

@web.Route("/")
helloWorld() => "Hello, World!";

main() {
  web.setupConsoleLog();
  web.start();
}
```

#### Installation
